Cache is a fast speed repository.
It is structured into two levels. Level 1 Cache is placed in CPU, while Level 2 Cache is placed between Level 1 Cache and the Main Memory.
According to Locality, Cache should be equipped with finer algorithm in order to be more efficient.
It works following the steps below.
1) CPU visits Cache.
2) If there is data, CPU gets to 4); otherwise, CPU gets to 3).
3) CPU copies blocks of data from the Main Memory and covers respective areas of Cache.
4) CPU deposits data in, or retrieve data from Cache.
